- **QSI (Quality of Student Experience Index)** ‚Äì measures student psychological, engagement, and academic experiences using psychometric data.

- Factor extraction (PCA for UEDI domains)
- Equity adjustment (Atkinson index & group gap penalties)
- Multiple weighting schemes (theory-driven, data-driven, decorrelated)
- Bootstrap-based uncertainty estimates
- Plausible value generation for psychometric domains (QSI)
- Outputs in intuitive 0‚Äì100 scales
- Optional appendices for detailed documentation, formulas, and example derivations

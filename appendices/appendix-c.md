#### C1. Comparative Instrument Table

| **Construct** | **Instrument** | **Typical Ages** | **Items** | **Admin Time** | **Licensing** | **Psychometrics (ω; notes)** | **Cross-Group Comparability** | **Strengths** | **Cautions** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Anxiety & depression (screen)** | RCADS-S | 11–18 | 25–47 | 8–12 min | Permission (research) | ω ≈ .85–.95 | Partial scalar likely; consider alignment | Broad internalizing coverage | Not diagnostic; duty-of-care triggers only |
| **Depression (adolescents)** | PHQ-A / PHQ-9 | 12–18 | 9 | 3–4 min | Public | ω ≈ .80–.90 | Good across many languages | Brief, validated | Screening, not diagnosis |
| **General anxiety** | GAD-7 | 12–18 | 7 | 2–3 min | Public | ω ≈ .85–.92 | Often scalar with small adjustments | Very brief | Ceiling under severe cases |
| **Stress (broad)** | DASS-21 | 15–18 | 21 | 7–8 min | Public | ω ≈ .85–.95 | Partial scalar common | Covers depression/anxiety/stress | Not ideal under 14 |
| **Achievement emotions** | AEQ (short) | 10–18 | 12–24 | 6–10 min | Research | ω ≈ .80–.90 | Partial scalar; align | Task/test emotions | Requires careful translation |
| **Test anxiety** | TAI / CTAS | 11–18 | 10–20 | 5–8 min | Mixed | ω ≈ .80–.90 | Reasonable | Evaluative context focus | Overlap with trait anxiety |
| **Motivation regulation** | AMS (short) | 11–18 | 12–20 | 6–8 min | Research | ω ≈ .75–.90 | Metric likely; scalar sometimes | SDT-aligned profiles | Some item redundancy |
| **Strategy / effort** | MSLQ (blocks) | 12–18 | 12–16 | 6–8 min | Research | ω ≈ .70–.85 | Acceptable with adaptation | Self-regulation snapshot | Social desirability sensitivity |
| **Self-efficacy (domain)** | Short curriculum-anchored set | 9–18 | 4–8 | 2–4 min | Public | ω ≈ .75–.90 | Good if domain-specific | Direct task link | Needs tight anchoring |
| **Perseverance** | Grit-S (perseverance) | 12–18 | 4 | 1–2 min | Public | ω ≈ .70–.80 | Mixed | Ultra-brief | Limited incremental validity |
| **Burnout (students)** | MBI-SS / SBI | 15–18 | 9–15 | 5–8 min | Proprietary / Research | ω ≈ .80–.90 | Adequate | Exhaustion/cynicism captured | Avoid clinical labels |
| **Inhibition** | Flanker / Stroop | 8–18 | — | 3–6 min | Open tasks | Split-half > .80 | Cross-device checks | Process-proximal | Practice effects across waves |
| **Working memory** | Digit Span / List Sorting | 8–18 | — | 4–7 min | Open / NIH Toolbox | Test–retest good | Typically robust | Brief, interpretable | Bandwidth limited |
| **Everyday EF** | BRIEF-2 / BDEFS-CA (teacher) | 6–18 | 12–30 | 5–10 min | Proprietary | ω ≈ .80–.95 | Usually stable | Ecological validity | Rater bias; licensing cost |
| **Academic self-concept** | ASDQ / SDQ-II (short) | 9–18 | 6–12 | 3–6 min | Research | ω ≈ .80–.90 | Metric/scalar often feasible | Domain-specific identity | Needs grade-aligned items |
| **School belonging** | PSSM | 11–18 | 8–18 | 3–6 min | Research | ω ≈ .80–.90 | Generally solid | Simple, widely used | Some items culture-specific |
| **Sleep triad** | Duration, quality, sleepiness | 10–18 | 3–5 | 1–2 min | Public | — | Usually fine | Ultra-low burden | Self-report bias; add admin data if possible |

**Notes:** ω values are typical ranges; re-estimate in-sample.  
If scalar invariance fails across language or grade, use partial-scalar or alignment and suppress cross-group mean comparisons otherwise.

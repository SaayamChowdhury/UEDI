### Appendix F. Sampling and Fieldwork Defaults

---

- **Design:** Stratified two-stage cluster (school → class).  
- **Targets:** Effective sample size per stratum for ±0.10 SD precision at 95% CI after accounting for design effects.  
- **Weights:** Base × nonresponse × post-stratification to enrollment margins; use replicate weights (e.g., BRR with Fay) for public reporting.  
- **Consent:** Institutional approval per local norms; opt-out for low-risk surveys; explicit opt-in where screeners are used.  
- **Duty-of-care triggers:** Applied only for screeners; refer students via existing support mechanisms; the study does **not** provide clinical diagnoses.

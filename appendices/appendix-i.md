### Appendix I. Translation, Cultural Adaptation, and Mode Equivalence

---

#### I.1 Process and Documentation
- Forward–back translation with reconciliation by a bilingual committee.  
- Cognitive debriefing with 5–8 students per age band (Primary, Lower Secondary, Upper Secondary) using think-aloud and targeted probes.  
- Maintain an **adjudication log** with item-level decisions (retain, revise, drop) and rationale.  
- Record reading level estimates and any cultural substitutions.

---

#### I.2 Equivalence Testing
- Multi-group CFA/IRT across language and administration mode (paper vs device).  
- **Release rules for cross-group mean comparisons:**  
  - **Scalar invariance:** ΔCFI ≤ 0.010 and ΔRMSEA ≤ 0.015 relative to metric.  
  - If scalar fails, use **alignment**; release if alignment **R² ≥ 0.95** for factor means.  
  - If neither criterion is met, suppress cross-group mean comparisons; report **within-group results only**.

---

#### I.3 Mode Checks
- Test mode effects (paper vs device) at **configural**, **metric**, and **scalar** levels.  
- If mode effects persist, estimate and apply **mode-specific anchors** or treat mode as a **grouping factor** in scoring.

---

#### I.4 Version Control
- Assign **semantic versions** to each language form (major.minor.patch).  
- Publish a **changelog** summarizing item edits and their impact on parameters.

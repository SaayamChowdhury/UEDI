### Appendix K. Missing Data, Planned Missingness, and Background Conditioning

---

#### K.1 Missingness Stance
- **Assumption:** Missing at random (MAR) for estimation.  
- **MNAR sensitivity:** Pattern-mixture checks as resources allow.  
- **Estimators:**  
  - FIML for ML/MLR  
  - Pairwise-present for WLSMV with robust corrections

---

#### K.2 Planned Missingness (Matrix Sampling)
- Item blocks with **overlap anchors** per construct; ensure at least **two common anchors** across forms.  
- Generate **5â€“10 plausible values (PVs)** per construct using **background conditioning** (grade, sex, SES, language).

---

#### K.3 Imputation / Reporting
- Report **missingness** by item and construct.  
- **Public release:** Do not impute individual-level responses; release **latent scale scores** with SEs only.

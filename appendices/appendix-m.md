### Appendix M. Sociological Measures and Equity Analytics

---

#### M.1 Variable Families
- **Equity & Inclusion:** SES index; gender/caste/ethnicity categories; Slope and Relative Indices of Inequality (SII/RII); Dissimilarity D; Theil’s H; exposure indices.  
- **Resources & Conditions:** pupil–teacher ratio, teacher qualification index, instructional time, facility index, neighborhood deprivation, exposure to violence.  
- **System Quality & Governance:** inspection frequency, accountability regime score, tracking/streaming age, curriculum autonomy, assessment stakes.  
- **Transitions & Economic Linkages:** attendance persistence, NEET, apprenticeship availability, youth employment rate.

---

#### M.2 Composites and Scaling
- Standardize input variables.  
- For composites, use documented weights or PCA with fixed loadings from a baseline year; publish loadings and stability checks.

---

#### M.3 Multilevel / SEM Linkage
- Multilevel models with students nested in classes/schools (and districts if available).  
- **Outcomes:** engagement, achievement.  
- **Predictors:** QSI domains and sociological composites; include cross-level interactions (e.g., QSI × Resources).  
- Use **survey weights** and **replicate weights** for SEs; report standardized coefficients with 95% CIs.

---

#### M.4 Segregation and Gradients
- Report **SII/RII** by SES deciles; compute **D** and **H** at the school level for specified subgroups; include exposure indices.  
- Publish **uncertainty** for each metric using replicate weights.
